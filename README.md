# ‚öôÔ∏èDeployment and Development (GitHub and Heroku)

### Deploy on Heroku

**Requirement and Procfile**

Before deployment on Heroku, two files need to be created and be up to date, a `requirements.txt` file and a `Procfile`.

- The `requirements.txt` file is created by executing the following command in the terminal window: ` pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`. A file with all requirements will be created.
- Then create a file named `Procfile` and insert the following code: `web: gunicorn fetch_petstore.wsgi`, with no empty lines after it.
- Then make sure to push these files to your repository.

**Creating Heroku App**

- Log into Heroku and go to the Dashboard.
- Click "New" and then select "Create new app".
- Give your app a name and select the region closest to you.
- Click "Create app" to confirm.

**Creating a database**

- Log into ElephantSQL.com and access your dashboard.
- Click "Create New Instance"
- Set up a plan, give your plan a **Name**, select the **Tiny Turtel (Free)** plan, leave the **Tags** field blank.
- Select "Select Region" and select a data center new you.
- Click "Review".
- Confirm your details and then click "Create instance".
- Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project.
- In the URL section, click the copy icon to copy the database URL.
- In your workspace make sure django and gunicorn are installed by running `pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn`.
- Equally make sure that infrastructure for the database is installed by running `pip3 install dj_database_url===0.5.0 psycopg2`.
- Update the `requirements.txt` file if needed.

**The env.py file**

- If you do not have a `env.py` file in your workspace create one and make sure it is included in the `.gitignore` file.
- At the top of the `env.py` file add the line: `import os`.
- Below that add the following two lines:

  `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "<copied URL from SQL database>"` <br>
  `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<create a secret key of your own>"` <br>

- Make sure the environment variables are imported correctly into the `settings.py` file.
- Run `python manage.py migrate` in the terminal window to migrate the data structure to the database instance.

**Setting Environment Variables**

- On the Heroku Dashboard select the app you just created and then select the "Settings" tab.
- Click "Reveal Config Vars"
- Add the following config vars: <br>

  `DATABASE_URL` - copy the database URL from ElephantSQL in here, it should also be in the `env.py` file. <br>
  `SECRET_KEY` - copy your secret key in here. <br>

**Configuring Django App for Heroku:**

  * Add `DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url_from_heroku>`
  * Add `SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>`
  * Add `USE_AWS=<True>`
  * Add `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_key_id>`
  * Add `AWS_BUCKET_NAME=<your_bucket_name>`
  * Add `AWS_REGION_NAME=<your_region_name>`
  * Add `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_access_key_id>`
  * Add `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=<your_default_from_email_name>`
  * Add `EMAIL_HOST_PASS=<your_email_host_pass>`
  * Add `EMAIL_HOST_USER=<your_email_host_user>`
  * Add `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=<your_mailchimp_api_key>`
  * Add `MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID=<your_mailchimp_audience_id>`
  * Add `MAILCHIMP_REGION=<your_mailchimp_region>`
  * Add `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your_stripe_public_key>`
  * Add `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your_stripe_secret_key>`
  * Add `STRIPE_WH_SECRET=<your_stripe_wh_secret>`


* Add these variables to the Heroku 'Config Vars'.
* Modify `settings.py` in your Django app.
  * Replace the default secret key with `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`.
  * Update the databases section to connect to the Heroku Postgres: `DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`.

**Setting Up AWS S3:**

* Visit [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and either sign in or create an account.
* Create a new S3 bucket and note down the necessary configurations like `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` and `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`.
* Add these variables to Heroku 'Config Vars'.
* Modify `settings.py` to configure AWS S3:
* Add AWS configurations for static and media files.


**Connecting to GitHub and Deploy**

- On the Heroku Dashboard select the app you just created and then select the "Deploy" tab.
- Select GitHub for the deployment method.
- Search for the name of the project repository and click "Connect".
- Further down the page, select "Enable Automatic Deploys" if desired.
- Then finally further down, select "Deploy Branch" and watch the app being built.

### Forking the Repository

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub repository you want to fork.
- At the top of the Repository above the "Settings" Tab on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button and click it.
- You will have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
- You will now be able to make changes to the new version and keep the original safe.

### Making a Local Clone

- Log into GitHub and locate the repository you want to clone.
- Click the 'Code' dropdown above the file list.
- Copy the URL for the repository.
- Open Git Bash in your IDE.
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
- Type `git clone` in the CLI and then paste the URL you copied earlier. This is what it should look like:
  `$ git clone https://github.com/`
- Press Enter to create your local clone.

You will need to install all of the packages listed in the requirements file you can use the following command in the terminal `pip install -r requirements.txt` which will do it for you.
